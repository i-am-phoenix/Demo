## PROJECT1<br>Impact of COVID on real estate market in Houston and beyond

Objective

Our objective was to understand what impact, if any, did COVID have on the real estate market in the US, in particular in Houston TX (vs other cities) and Harris county (vs other counties in TX)

Methodology & Data Sourcing

Our methodology was to seek data from 3 main sources of information:

1. Real Estate Data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) 
2. COVID data via [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/about/how-to-use-our-data)
3. Demographic data from [US Census](https://txcip.org/tac/census/) 

Three separate Jupyter Notebooks were then used to clean and pre-process the data:

[zillow_data_cleaning_functions.ipynb](zillow_data_cleaning_functions.ipynb) (real estate)
